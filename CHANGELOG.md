## Requirements

### Linux
All builds require standard system libraries:
```bash
# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt-get install libfreetype6 libgl1 libx11-6 libxrandr2 libxinerama1 libxcursor1 libxi6


# Fedora/Red Hat
sudo dnf install freetype mesa-libGL libX11 libXrandr libXinerama libXcursor libXi

# SUSE
sudo zypper install freetype2 Mesa-libGL libX11-6 libXrandr2 libXinerama1 libXcursor1 libXi6
```

### macOS
You need to execute this in the terminal before launching the app as macOS shows this error because the app is not code-signed.
macOS Gatekeeper blocks unsigned apps downloaded from the internet by setting a "quarantine" attribute.
```bash
xattr -cr <location-of-the-.app>
```

### Windows
No additional dependencies required.
